            <h2> What is the European Conference of Humanities? </h2>
            <p> Online event organized by UNESCO, CIPSH and FCT. When is it? 5th to 7th of May. Debate and plan the approach to cross-cutting societal issues, highlighting the specific contribution of the Humanities to our world, in close cooperation with researchers from other disciplines, such as natural, social, engineering and medical sciences. Discuss educational and scientific policies, as well as processes of social dissemination of knowledge </p>

            <h2> Logo concept </h2>
            <p> At a conceptual level, the logo meets the transversality, diversity and dynamism of the Humanities area. It is thus constituted by a nucleus that represents the starting point: The union of the diverse areas that constitute the Humanities. The expansion of this same nucleus that represents connections and ties. At the ends, the ramifications that represent the existing dynamism and diversity. The logo can be multiplied infinitely. </p>

            <h2> The visual identity of the conference </h2>
            <p> The visual identity of the conference must follow the same concept as the logo. Be an extension of the logo. The visual identity must be present in all communication material of the conference. So we can find it on the main poster, on the three secondary posters and on the online material (promotional video, presentation separator slides, etc). </p>

        <div>
            <h2> Digital and physical world </h2>
            <p> Due to the pandemic climate, it was not possible for the conference to take place in person as planned. So it was important that the communication material was possible to be in a physical environment (like the posters scattered around the city) but also in the digital world. </p>
            <p> Digital is a vast world so it was important to prioritize and it was decided that priority would be given to posters that could be seen and disseminated on social networks. All the material had to be developed in a way to be easily adaptable. </p>
