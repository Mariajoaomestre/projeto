            <h2>The brand name and logo</h2>
            <p>As the name suggests Laces & Enlaces is an online store whose focus is mainly on macramé and its countless creative varieties. The strong sound of the name already reveals a large part of the reason why it would be essential for the logo to accompany it visually. Laces & Enlaces is a combination of both parts which intertwined merge into one and constitute the main logo of the brand.</p>

            <h2>Social networks and colors</h2>
            <p>Laces & Enlaces is a new brand of Macramés that aims to strengthen its position in the online market. The Visual Identity created to give a voice to the brand also came to integrate social networks such as Facebook.</p>
            <p>With regard to the colors used, it was intended that they would meet the original style of Macramés. It was chosen as main tones: pink, blue and baby brown in order to convey the subtlety and delicacy of the pieces and also the brand Laces & Enlaces.</p>

            <h2>The illustrations</h2>
            <p>In order to complete the visual identity of the brand, a series of illustrations of makramés were developed. These illustrations follow the colors of the brand as well as the intended visual guidelines. The logo and illustrations can be separate, but when the power of both is combined and the visual aspect is reinforced.</p>

            <h2>The inspiration for this project</h2>
            <p>The inspiration for this project was born mainly from the name of the brand, which in itself is very suggestive. Laces means something that is entwined, curled, etc. In my mind, the logo could only follow that visual idea and do it justice.</p>
            <p>However, the sonority of the name and the thematic (makramé) of something made by hand with time and passion was also a strong inspiration. I knew right away that the brand image would have to arouse good feelings in potential customers and convey that passion and delicacy typical of this art.</p>
