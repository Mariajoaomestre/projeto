            <h2>What is the Tale Trail app?</h2>
            <p>Tale trail is a digital reading platform in which the contents are short episodic stories made available continuously. 
                It resembles a television series format. Tale Trail is a digital reading platform that revolutionizes and breaks the barriers of traditional reading.</p>

            <h2>The purpose of the application</h2>
            <p>Tale Trail wants to bring all readers a democratization of reading. It also aims to be a pleasant experience for all users. Its main objective is to create a reading habit since the chapters of each book are only released weekly. Finally, this application took into account the fact that more and more users have a shorter attention span.</p>

            <h2>Combination of two worlds</h2>
            <p>The Tale Trail digital reading platform bridges the gap between the old and the new. At the first, it seeks the concept of having something available without having to wait: new chapters of the various books that are available on the platform come out weekly. The modern is looking for an organization so typical of streaming platforms. This combination forms the entire platform and brings users closer to what reading is and its importance often.</p>

            <h2>Customizing the reading experience</h2>
            <p>It is an application that wants to provide a pleasant reading experience to all its users but we know that reading on a screen is more difficult than reading on paper. More tiring too. Each user will have their preference for the intensity of the screen light. So the interface has two modes: light and dark. It is the user who chooses the one he prefers.</p>
            <p>However, the dark version is not the only thing that the user can use and customize. When you are on the reading pages, the reader can also choose the font size he wants or whether he wants serififed font or not. Without forgetting that it is also possible for the user to select the option to hear the story.</p>
